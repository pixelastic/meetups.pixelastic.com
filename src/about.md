Hello,

My name is Tim Carry and I'm a Developer Advocate at [Algolia][1].

I live in Paris, a city with an incredible number of tech meetups and
conferences. I also travel a lot to conferences around Europe.

I think information in valuable only if shared, so I try to publish notes about
thoses events on this website. It also helps me remember everything I learn.

Sources are available on [GitHub][2]. Contributions and corrections are welcome.

Sharing is caring.

Tim
