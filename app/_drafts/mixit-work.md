## Il est temps de repenser notre manière de travailler

First punch talk of the day, that will set the tone for others talks afterwards.
Marie-Cécile Paccard made us think about what working means.

More and more jobs of our world can be automated. We know that. We contribute to
that. Every line of code we write is meant to do a job a human being could do,
but in a much faster way. New tech advancement will put out of business previois
jobs. Think press and internet, taxi drivers and uber, uber drivers and self
driving cars.

Many more jobs will be replaced by "robots", automated. Still, we're still
talking about unemployment rate and considering that employment is the solution
to our issues. Working is not a solution, it is a mean to an end.

"So what? Are we going to pay people to do nothing?" is the basic knee-jerk
reaction. It seems unfair. We worked hard for our money, so others should too.
So we make people do things in companies, so they can get paid. Being paid doing
nothing just does not seem right, so we ask them to do something. Anything. The
video shows people as chairs, traffic light, etc. They are "working", even if
it's useless. Getting money for not doing anything seems so wrong, that we
prefer giving money for doing something useless.

And that's when the "burn out" occurs. When you consider what you're doing is so
meaningless that you just can't do it anymore. You even consider killing
yourself because the thought of wasting your life doing things you hate and that
are useless abhorrs you.

When this occurs you start considering if it's your fault. If you did something
wrong. If you're too weak to handle. Or maybe it's someone's else fault?
Management maybe?

In the end the burnout is just a symptom of a society that is sick, at large.
The way paid work is wokring in our society justdoes not make any sense. You
have bullshit jobs, middle management jobs, popping up everywhere.

But deep inside you you feel that this is not right. And this gut feeling, you
need to listen to it. Human bodies are a very impressive technology. They've
been in production for thousand of years. No-one really understands how it
works. It's full of legacy code that never had any documentation, and we're
trying to reverse-engineering it. But it has survived thousand of years of war,
epidemies and worse things. It contains defense mechanisms against harm. Even if
we don't understand them, they are still here, and we need to listen to this
warnings.

When your gut feeling tells you something is not right, it's not just random. It
has a cause. You can't specifically say why, but your body knows, and you'd
better listen to it.

And the issue might be coming from the Taylorism approach to jobs we have today.
We split jobs in small parts. One person will do step X, the next will do step
Y and so one. Each step is small enough that anyone could learn it quickly. It
does not require much experience. For sure, you can produce things quicker and
cheaper if you build them following a taylored chain.

But you remove goals to people. They don't build a clock anymore. They build
a tiny screw. They have no purpose in what they are building, they have no
expertise, they could build screws for clocks or for anything else and that
would be the same. The end goal is lost.

It reminded me of this story of a man seeing another, at work with a hammer and
"burin" on a stone. When asked "What do you do?", you often have three different
answers:
1. I work
2. I carve a stone
3. I build a cathedral

Person in 1 just have a job, they don't care what it is. They do their part and
get paid for it, that's it. Person in 2 have more expertise in what they are
doing, they want to do a good job of it, and be proud of what they do. People in
3 have a bigger goal in mind, they are not only carving for themselves, but for
the commnity as a whole.

As said, by limiting people to do only one thing in their job, you're losing
valuable experience. You're making every employee interchangeable. They're all
the same. They have to specific expertise.

And on a personal level it means that you're losing your personal interest at
doing your work. 

At Algolia, our main value is ownership. We trust employees to do things in the
best way. Let experts be experts. They have goals, maybe large ones, but they
have the grit and the opportunity to do it. We won't micro manage to ask them to
do one thing only.

And in a world were jobs are getting more and more meaningless, people are
losing their motivation, work day are feeling less and less real. To compensate,
companies are rying to artificially inject "humaness" into the companies. We
over-humanise work. We force team uilding, after work, pinball and socialising
events. We're trying to make the work place into a social place. 

But we still don't define the clean boundaries between the two. We ask employees
to be "involved" in their work, to show "passion". We're assessing the human
aspect of employees, not their expertise. We are assessing the value of an
employee no longer on objective work output, but on subjective personal views.

It can creates huge dissonances that can lead to burnout. When you work, you
sell you professional expertise. You're not hired because you're good looking or
fun, you're hired because you have expertise into a specific field, and you're
selling this expertise.

This dissonance is visible on many layers. We talk about Human Resources. It's
either Human, or a Resource, it cannot be both. We kept the taylorisme, but we
tried to artifically inject humain on top of it. And we're now right in the
uncanny valley, where the human aspect is human enough to feel real, but
deshumanised enough so it feels horribly wrong.

All this forced humanisation of work is often badly done by companies. They try
to infantilise people. Doing costumed parties, trying to attract people at booth
with video games and lollipops. They're basically saying: "We don't care about
you, we care about your skills." When you want people to act as adults, you
treat them as adults. If you give them video games and lollipops as benefits of
their workplace, you're actively treating them as child, telling them they
should not take initiative/ownership. They are just one more developer to add to
your cheptel, they all look the same, you're only interested in their skills so
you can send them on a mission. Who are they? You don't care, they're just one
more developer you'll be able to trick with shiny gadgets and fire later.

Technically, work is not only paid work. Every other activity you do on your
free time, like gardening, repair work, playing an instrument, is still work.
It's just not paid work. Some people are paid to do it. There are gardeners,
repair man, professional musician. They are paid to do it, but not you.

The world of today expect us to be able to handle our financial needs with our
paid work. Paid work has a specific status. We consider that people that don't
have paid work are not working. That's not true. Unpaid work is still work. If
you decide to build a website for free to a friend, it's still work. It will be
the same quality as the one you'll build for a customer. So not being paid for
something does not mean this something is less valuable.

CDI is powerful, you got easier access to loans, better social status. And
companies are actually deciding who gets a CDI or not, having a huge impact on
people lifes. We need to not think less of people that are unemployed, or having
an status different than a CDI. A CDI is seen as a stable position, it will be
harder to fire you, you'll have your job for longer. Actually, as developers we
don't care. It's so easy for us to find jobs, with a CDI or not, we won't have
any issue. Also, it's common to move company every ~4 years so...

We need to set clear limits of what work is and what it isn't. People need to
think about their personal goals, and personal values. It takes some time, but
write it down, and live by them. It makes choices easier, and let you spot when
youre gong on the wrong path sooner.

=> Talk Blend Web Mix

If jobs are so meaningless and that they will be obsolete soon anyway, why don't
we just give money to everyone. Not because they worked, but because they exist
and a robot is doing their job. Robots stealing job should not be a bad thing,
it should be a good one. It means the money that was given to you to do a job
can now be given to you for not doing it. And you can do many other things in
your free time.
