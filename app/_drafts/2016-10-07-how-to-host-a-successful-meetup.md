So you want to host a meetup at your company? Great! We've been attending and
hosting our fair share of meetups at Algolia in the past years, so I'm compiling
notes here to help and guide you in the process. It should help you making sure
nothing is forgotten and that your event is a blast.

Organizing a meetup usually takes us about two weeks. Sometimes we have to do it
in less, but it is then much more demanding in terms of time and energy.

## Save the date

We start by finding a date that works both for the meetup organizer and for us.
We also check on meetup.com that it is not conflicting with another popular
meetups in town, or with any national holidays.

We also try to avoid hosting more than two meetups on the same week, and
definitly not two days in a row. We also avoid hosting them on Thursday as it
would clash with our weekly Happy Hour.

Sometimes we have to make compromises, but we always check with the team through
Slack or email before committing to anything.

Once the date is set, we add it to a shared calendar so everyone is aware of it.
We add it even if the dates are not 100% confirmed, or if we have multiple
potential dates. This will prevent us saying "yes" to two meetups and having to
cancel one of them.

The event in the calendar will become the single point of thuth regarding the
meetup. We put every important information (more on that later) in it, so every
one has an easy access to it. 

## Create your meetup team

We define one team member as the meetup owner, and two sidekicks. The meetup
owner job will be to make sure that everything is ready in time, and will be the
go-to person for any questions. The sidekicks are here so the owner can delegate
some tasks to them.

Sidekicks will also be of great help the day of the event. They will help
attendees to the room, help speaker plug their laptop, handle the food delivery
and more generally help people feel comfortable.

## Get all the information

A great meetup is made of a lot of tiny things. We put all relevant information
in the Google Calendar event so anyone in the team can refer to it. Here is
a list of things we want to know beforehand:

- How many people will be there? (It can be an approximate number, but make sure
  it does not overflow your room capacity)
- When does the event starts and ends?
- What is the meetup.com page url?
- How many talks will there be? What are the subjects? How long will they be?
- How to contact the meetup organizer?

## Two weeks before

Two weeks before the event we send a message to the team to tell them about the
event, why we host it and why we think it makes sense for us to host it. When we
have the list of speakers and subjects of the talks, we also share them at that
point.

We also send a tweet at the same time, with a link to the meetup.com page. We
usually tweet it with the corporate account. Employees usually also tweet it
with their own account. Because we have offices in San Francisco and Paris, we
also make sure to specify the city where the meetup will take place.

## One week before

We send another tweet with the link to the meetup.com page, to gather the last
attendees.

## 48 hours before

2 days before the event we have a pretty accurate idea of the number of
attendees, so we can start ordering the food. We try to time the delivery of the
food to arrive during the last talk. That way we still have time to setup it on
the tables and the food stays warm. Keep in mind to order some vegetarian and
gluten-free food as well.

At Algolia the room where we host meetups is also the room where we happen to
eat at lunch, so we also need to take care of changing the chair and table
configuration. It's also a good time to check that we have enough chairs for
everyone.

## 24 hours before

One day before we sent a last email to the team (maybe they'd like to wear their
Algolia shirts that day to be easily identified).

When we host meetups in our office, we usually present what Algolia is doing. We
keep it under 5mn max. People do not come to hear about us, they came to see the
talks, so there is no point in bothering them at that point. We find someone to
deliver this intro pitch the day before.

Our room has a pretty nice video setup that lets us record the talks. We make
sure that everything is working and that the owner of the meetup knows how it
works.

Finally, we send one last tweet about the event.

## The day of the event

Once they get to you


The day of the event
Make sure that people can find their way to the event:
Remind them with a Tweet (personal and/or corporate account)
Make sure the map indications on the Meetup page are valid
Add signs from the ground floor to the room
Block access to the open-space with kakemonos
Prepare a bowl with some swags (keyrings, stickers) so people can easily help themselves.
Shut down the dashboards
Make sure to put some beers for the event in the Fridge (sync with Kumiko) at least 4 hours before the event

You should also put someone from the team on the ground level to open the door
for the attendees.
During the event
Once the event is started, the person on the ground floor should go back to the
office. People from the team should wear an Algolia shirt to be easily
recognizable, and be as helpful as possible.

Don’t forget to actually START the recording :)

You can provide water bottles to the speakers, and more generally show where the
toilets are and show the wifi codes. Check that the room is not too cold, nor
too hot. Mostly it's listening to what the people have to say, and make them
comfortable.

People usually arrive late, so be ready to open the doors for them. Also
regularly check Twitter or meetup.com for messages.

During the talks, it's nice if you can take pictures and post them on Twitter
(one picture per talk is best). If you’re inspired by some quotes, don’t hesitate to tweet them as well (including the event #hashtag and speaker @handle).

After the talks people usually gather around food to discuss. Most meetups ends
up around 10.30pm, but the rule is: it ends when you want it to end. You're the
host, so it's your call, don't feel obligated to stay late if you don't want to.
Right after the event
You can usually ask the last people that stays to help you with the cleaning. Basically it's putting back all the chairs and tables so they can be used for lunch on the following day.

You should also make sure there is no trash left and that the place is clean.
Post-event
After the event is over, you should share all interesting information with the
team. This can take the form of an email post-mortem and should contain the
following informations:
Was the event a success?
What worked and what didn't?
Do you think we should do it again?
Did we learn any valuable information?

You should also log into Asana other bits of information so we can track meetups
on the long run:
Were the organizers reactive?
How many people actually came compared to the number registered?
Did we waste any food?
How much did the event cost?

You can also send specific informations to specific teams:
Sales will be interested in any leads or interesting information from customers or prospects
Marketing will be interested in the list of attendees
Recruiting will be interested in promising profiles you might have met

You should also grab the videos from the Drive and upload them to YouTube. Once
it's done, send a tweet mentioning the author, along with the link to the
video. You should also post the links in the comments of the meetup.com page.
