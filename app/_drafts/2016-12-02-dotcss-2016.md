## Varya Stepanova
patternt libraries, focuses on componentsn stle guides and yooling for
developers
proud to be lazy, want a "one-button" press that will do weverything
less uman involved, less human mistakes
more code = more reusaibility

yandex, russina google (mail, search, calendar)
lego blocks to reuse copmnent in all applications

how to mihrate between version?
not only update the lib, need to update the html/js
update on 200 websites at once, + satellite libraries

solution: do not use exact html
only use "asbtract tree" (page > header > logo + search > sidebar, etc)
tooling would update the html, so new version means changing the tooling, not
the code of each app

works, but developers need to follow a file structure and specific tech
complex config, need to really know it

SC5
do not fix technical problmes, help people instead
living styleguides, styleguide-first, code genetaed updates, developer can see
what it looks like. If not in the styleguide, cannot use it.


sc5-styleguide navigable styleguide which renders every component separatley
still problem when update versionbut this time because everything is automated
we might not know what is roken

sc5-styleguide-visualtest
visual regression tests
pass tests to see how the output looks by changing the markup. output should be
equal, even if underlyong code is not
have cli and visial human verificatoin
put it in OSS, peole contributed

## Philip Walton
Darks ide of polyffilling CSS

Houdini, low-levels API to polyfill CSS

new keyword, `random`, between 0 and 1
in js, you can check if method exists and fi not, rewrite it? how do you do that
in CSS?
find CSS Objectodel and update it here (in js)
but issue because if browser does not know a value, it will drop it before we
can change it
so need to get the raw CSS and parse and update

need to parse manually, browser can't help us parse it
Use the postCSS parser to get an AST
loop through each of them, update it, and replace in the page
add a new style element to override

works but all random values the same

can add inline styles to each elements matching with random value
does not work becase will break the cascade, the inline will always take
precedence

or, update only if it's the last matching rule. won't match either , too many
CSS rules

give a unique id to each matching elmeent and reference it in the CSS
will also break the specificify, need to update the base specificity to all
elements so the new one are not more specific

does not handle DOM changes, shadow dom, inline styles
still requires a lot of code, does not work with CORS, slow if change a lot of
events/resize

innovation will be as slow as the slowest browser. it hould be in the ends of
developers
